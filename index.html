    <pre>
   The following paper will present one of the most profound advancements in the field of particle physics.
   i will be outlining all the important aspects when it comes to the understanding of neutrinos, how our understanding
   has revolutionised over the years and how it's also vital when it comes to interpreting our universe. i will explore
   how neutrino research postulated in the early 20th century by Wolfgang Pauli leading to major experiments such as the 
   Superkamiokade project which played a vital role in the breakthrough of discovering neutrinos possessing a mass. in addition 
   to this, i will cover areas ranging from the solar neutrino problem to theoretical ideas and frameworks such as the majorana 
   fermion and neutrinoless double beta decay ultimately answering why the discovery of non-zero mass neutrinos is so important.
   i will also consider the implications neutrino oscillations will have on the standard model as well as the significance of charge
   conjunction parity symmetry(cp-violation) when it comes to understanding the discrepancies between particles and antiparticles.

    Neutrinos are one of the fundamental particles described by the standard model which constitutes as one of the building 
    blocks to the universe. They were initially discovered in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauil in order to conserve energy and
    momentum within the weak interaction of beta decay.[1] Neutrinos are split into three different flavours which are electron,
    muon and tau neutrinos. In the 1960s and 1970s scientists made predictions regarding the number of electron lepton neutrinos
    detected on earth that were produced in the sun primarily through nuclear fusion. When detecting these neutrinos there was a large
    discrepancy within the models scientist came up with and the actual data illustrating a significantly lower number of neutrinos 
    detected than expected. This was referred to as the solar neutrino problem. As a consequence of this, it resulted in the 
    discovery of neutrino oscillations explaining this deficit in solar neutrinos and revolutionised our understanding of 
    neutrinos as a whole.[2] Neutrinos were thought to be massless but in fact have a very small mass. This is evident by their nature
    of being able to pass through large amounts of matter without being affected. In fact trillions of neutrinos pass through the human 
    body every second.

  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>

    Neutrinos are unique amongst the particles of the standard model due to their change in nature. This is known as neutrino oscillations, when
    a neutrinos flavour changes whilst travelling through space. This is due to a mismatch in quantum states when propagating through free space
    as the mass eigenstate doesn't match the flavour eigenstate resulting in this change in nature.[3] For example, when an electron lepton neutrino 
    produced from the sun propagates freely in space, its flavour composition changes due to the flavour eigenstate not having a definitive mass
    as it’s too small. This premise explains the basis of neutrino oscillations and how they happen. Neutrino oscillations can be modelled by the
    Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix (PMNS) which is a lepton/neutrino mixing unitary matrix essentially showing the different probabilities of 
    finding a neutrino of a specific flavour. it's a 3x3 unitary matrix which means that the sum of the probabilities of finding a particular 
    flavour adds up to 1. This behaviour is similar to that of schrodinger's cat in a box thought experiment in the sense each electron, muon or tau
    neutrino could simultaneously have a mass of m1, m2 or m3 until the mass is actually measured and determined just like how the cat is thought
    to dead and alive simultaneously until the box is opened.[4] The T2K Neutrino oscillation experiment provides information regarding mixing angles 
    and mass-squared differences which can be used to reconstruct the matrix. The mixing angles determines the different amplitudes of the neutrino
    oscillations and how the different flavour states are mixed together and the mass squared differences refer to the differences in the square
    of the 3 mass eigenstates. Furthermore, There's also a cp violation phase within the matrix which explains how neutrinos with definite
    eigenstates of flavour (electron, muon, tau), don't have corresponding definite eigenstates of mass allowing for this phenomenon to occur.[5] 
    It explains the differences between the behaviour of neutrinos and antineutrinos implying that oscillation probabilities for neutrinos would 
    be different to that of anti-neutrinos.

       the homestake experiment was crucial in the development of discovering neutrino oscillations as it provided the first
      experimental evidence for the solar neutrino problem. The experiment used a large underground chlorine-based liquid tank 
      which contained chlorine-37 atoms. These chlorine atoms would interact with solar neutrinos resulting in argon-37 atoms 
      to be formed, in turn showing the number of solar neutrinos detected. Consequently This resulted in only approximately
      a third of flux neutrinos observed based on what was expected from the theoretical models resutling in the rise of the 
      solar neutrino problem. The experiment was conducted by Raymond Davis in the 1960s to early 1990s postulating further 
      neutrino experiments and resulting in Raymond receiving a nobel prize in 2002 signifying the importance of his work. 

      The SuperKamiokande experiment was the first experiment to provide evidence for neutrino oscillations. Its purpose was to 
      find different properties of neutrinos which include their masses and measuring and refining the mixing angles. the three 
      predominate mixing angles which parameterised the PMNS matrix are θ12,θ23,θ13 as well as a cp violating phase δcp. θ12 
      represents the mixing between the electron lepton neutrinos flavour state and mass eigenstates. θ23 shows the mixing 
      between the muon and tau neutrinos. θ13 shows the mixing between all 3 flavours of neutrinos. The SuperKamiokande is a
      50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector as shown in figure 1. When a charged particle is produced from a neutrino interaction,
      If the speed of the charged particle is faster than the speed of light within the water, this will produce Cherenkov radiation.

      The T2K experiment is a long-baseline experiment which looks at specifically the change in nature of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos 
      located in Tokai at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). The T2k aims to measure the neutrinos flux and energy at the near
      INGRID (Interactive Neutrino GRID) and far (SuperKamiokande) detectors. In doing so it can measure the changes in the flux of neutrinos and
      compare results from each detector. T2Ks relation to a cp violation phase (δcp) is due to this change in flavor from muon into electron neutrinos.
      The T2K collected data is used as a part of an international collaboration that integrates data from multiple neutrino oscillation investigations across 
      the globe.[7] Our understanding of neutrino parameters is improved by global fits and analyses that combine T2K data with findings from NOvA (in the us)
      and reactor neutrino investigations resulting in the data from this experiment to have a significant impact towards solving the puzzle of CP violation
      in the neutrino sector as well as refining the mixing angles.

   The mechanism for generating neutrino masses is not yet fully understood despite oscillations being observed, but there are several 
   theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain it. Firstly there's the notion of neutrinos being a Majorana fermion, which implies that
   neutrinos in itself are their own antiparticle. This in turn leads to the idea of neutrinoless double beta decay because as we know a 
   neutrino is produced from a beta + or - decay despite its nature of being a particle or antiparticle, this would in turn lead to
   annihilation between the two neutrinos.[8]

   The following paper will present one of the most profound advancements in the field of particle physics.
   i will be outlining all the important aspects when it comes to the understanding of neutrinos, how our understanding
   has reveloutionaised over the years and how its also vitial when it comes to interpreting our universe. i will explore
   how neutrino research postulated in the early 20th centuray by Wolfgang Pauli leading to major experiments such as the 
   Superkamiokade project which played a vital role in the breakthrough of discovering neutrinos possesing a mass. in addition 
   to this, i will cover areas ranging from the solar neutrino problem to theoretical ideas and frameworks such as the majorana 
   fermion and neutrinoless double beta decay ultimatley answering why the discovering of non-zero mass neutrinos is so important.
   i will also consider the implications neutrino oscillations will have on the standard model as well as the significance of charge
   conjuction parity symmetry(cp-violation) when it comes to understanding the descrepecies between particles and anti-particles.

    Neuatrinos are one of the fundemental particles described by the standand model which constiutes as one of the buidling 
    blocks to the universe. Neutrinos were initally disocovered in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauil in order to conseverse energy and
    momentum within the weak interaction of beta decay. Neutrinos are split into three diffrent flavours which are electron,
    muon and tau neutrinos. In the 1960s and 1970s scientists made predictions regarding the number of electron lepton neutrinos
    dected on earth that were produced in sun primarily through nuclear fusion. When dectecting these neatrinos there was a large
    discrepency within the models scientist came up with and the actual data illustrating a signicantly lower number of nuetrinos 
    detected than expected. This was reffered to as the solar neutrino problem. As a concequence of this, it resulted in the 
    disccovery of neutrino oscillations explaining this decficit in solar neutrinos and reveloutionsed our understanding of 
    neuatrinos as a whole. Neutrinos were thought to be massless but in fact have a very small mass. this is evident by their nature
    of being able to pass through large amounts of matter without being effected. In fact trillions of neutrinos from the sun pass 
    through the human body every second.

    Neutrinos are unique amongst the particles of the standard model as they can change their nature. This is known as neutrino oscillations, when
    a neutrinos flavour changes whilst travelling through space. This is due to a mismatch in quantum states when propagating through free space
    as the mass eigenstate dosent match the flavour eigenstate resulting in this change in nature. For example, when an electron lepton neutrino 
    produced from the sun propagates freely in space, its flavour composition changes due to the flavour eigenstate not having a definitive mass
    as it’s too small. This premise explains the basis of neutrino oscillations and how they happen. Neutrino oscillations can be modelled by the
    Pontectorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix (PMNS) which is a lepton/neutrino mixing unitary matrix essentially showing the different probabilities of 
    finding a neutrino of a specific flavour. its a 3x3 unitary matrix which means that the sum of the probabilities of finding a particular 
    flavour add up to 1. This behaviour is similar to that of schrodinger's cat in a box thought experiment in the sense each electron, muon or tau
    neutrino could simultaneously have a mass of m1, m2 or m3 until the mass is actually measured and determined just like how the cat is thought
    to dead and alive simultaneously until the box is opened. The T2K Neutrino oscillation experiment provides information regarding mixing angles 
    and mass-squared differences which can be used to reconstruct the matrix. The mixing angles determines the diffrent amplitudes of the neutrino
    oscillations and how the diffrent flavour states are mixed together and the mass squared diffreneces refer to the diffrences in the square
    of the 3 mass eigenstates. Furthermore, There's also a cp violation phase within the matrix which explains how neutrinos with definite
    eigenstates of flavour (electron, muon, tau), don't have corresponding definite eigenstates of mass allowing for this phenomenon to occur. 
    It explains the diffrences between the behaviour of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos implying that oscillation probabilites for neutrinos would 
    be diffrent to that of anti-neutrinos. <a href=”#(GISGeography,2023)”>(GISGeography,2023)</a>

      the homestake experiment was crucial in the development of discovering neutrino oscillations as it provided the first
      experimental evidence for the solar neutrino problem. The experiment invovled using a large underground chlorine-based
      liquid tank which contained chlorine-37 atoms. These chlorine atoms would interact with the solar neutrinos resulting
      in argon-37 atoms to be formed in turn showing how many solar neutrinos were detected. This resulted in only approximately
      a third of flux neutrinos observed based on what was expected from the theoretical models. The experiment was conducted by 
      Raymond Davis in the 1960s to early 1990s postulating further neutrino experiments and resulting in Raymond receiving a 
      nobel prize in 2002 signifying the importance of his work. 

      The SuperKamiokande experiment was the first experiment to provide evidence for neutrino oscilllations. Its purpose was to 
      find diffrent properties of neutrinos which inculded their masses and measuring and refining the mixing angles. the three 
      predominate mixing angles which parametises the PMNS matrix are θ12,θ23,θ13 as well as a cp violating phase δcp. θ12 
      represents the mixing between the electron letpon neutrinos flavour state and mass egienstates. θ23 shows the mixing 
      betweenthe muon and tau neutrinos. θ13 shows the mixing between all 3 flavours of neutrinos. The SuperKamiokande is a
      50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector as show in figure 1. When a charged particle is produced from a neutrino interaction,
      if the speed of the charged particle is faster than the speed of light within the water, this will produce cherenkov radiation
      in the form of coned shaped flashes of blue light. In doing so were able to use photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which are within 
      the SuperKamiokande to measuere the intensity as well as the timing of the flashes of blue light allowing us to recostruct 
      the trajectory and find the energies of these particles  impling the type of neutrino.

      the T2K experiment proved cp viloation showing that the neutrino and anti neutrino have diffrent probabilities 
      NOva experiment contributed to this aswell ( in the us)

   In essence the standard model makes the assumption that neutrinos are massless and have a fixed flavour. as we've explored this is 
   not the case suggesting a massive gap in our framework of understanding outlining a flaw within the standard model. this is important
   as the SM is one of if not the most successful model when it comes to understanding a wide range of phenomena in the subatomic realm. 
   The mechanism for generating neutrino masses is not yet fully understood despite oscilliations being observed, but there are several 
   theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain it. Firstly theres the notion of neutrinos being a Majorana fermion, whih implies that
   neutrinos initself are its own anti-particle. This in turn leads to the idea of neutrinoless double beta decay because as we know a 
   neutrino is produced from a beta + or - decay despite its nature of being a particle or anti particle, this would in turn lead to
   anihillation between the two neutrinos.

    <pre>
   The following paper will present one of the most profound advancements in the field of particle physics.
   i will be outlining all the important aspects when it comes to the understanding of neutrinos, how our understanding
   has reveloutionaised over the years and how its also vitial when it comes to interpreting our universe. i will explore
   how neutrino research postulated in the early 20th centuray by Wolfgang Pauli leading to major experiments such as the 
   Superkamiokade project which played a vital role in the breakthrough of discovering neutrinos possesing a mass. in addition 
   to this, i will cover areas ranging from the solar neutrino problem to theoretical ideas and frameworks such as the majorana 
   fermion and neutrinoless double beta decay ultimatley answering why the discovering of non-zero mass neutrinos is so important.
   i will also consider the implications neutrino oscillations will have on the standard model as well as the significance of charge
   conjuction parity symmetry(cp-violation).

        Neuatrinos are one of the fundemental particles described by the standand model which constiutes as one of the buidling 
        blocks to the universe. they are split into three diffrent flavours know as electron, muon, tau neutrinos and known to 
        be products of beta decay via the weak interaction. in the 1960s and 1970s scientists made predictions regarding the types
        and number of neutrinos dected when on earth produced from the solar fusion processes within the earth. when dectecting neutrinos 
        were thought to be massless but in fact have a very small mass. this is due to their nature of being able to pass through 
        large amounts of matter without being effected. in fact trillions of neuatrinos from the sun pass through our bodies every 
        second.

  <p class="ex1">

    Neutrinos are unique amongst the particles of the standard model as they can change their nature. This is known as neutrino oscillations, when
    a neutrinos flavour changes whilst travelling through space. This is due to a mismatch in quantum states when propagating through free space
    as the mass eigenstate dosent match the flavour eigenstate resulting in this change in nature. For example, when an electron lepton neutrino 
    produced from the sun propagates freely in space, its flavour composition changes due to the flavour eigenstate not having a definitive mass
    as it’s too small. This premise explains the basis of neutrino oscillations and how they happen. Neutrino oscillations can be modelled by the
    Pontectorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix which is a quark mixing unitary matrix essentially showing the different probabilities of finding a
    neutrino of a specific flavour. The matrix being unitary ensures that the sum of the probabilities of finding a particular flavour add up to 1.
    This behaviour is similar to that of schrodinger's cat in a box thought experiment in the sense each electron, muon or tau neutrino could 
    simultaneously have a mass of m1, m2 or m3 until the mass is actually measured and determined just like how the cat is thought to dead and alive
    simultaneously until the box is opened. The T2K Neutrino oscillation experiment provides information regarding mixing angles and mass-squared
    differences which can be used to reconstruct the matrix. There's also a cp violation phase within the matrix which ultimately explains how 
    neutrinos with definite eigenstates of flavour (electron, muon, tau), don't have corresponding definite eigenstates of mass allowing for this 
    phenomenon to occur. 
    
    
    talk about changes in flavour and how the mass eigenstate doesn't match the flavour eigenstate the type of neutrino changes. 
    Most neutrinos in the sun are lepton neutrinos.

    write here.. talk about the intial understanding and perception of neutrinos, how their understanding changed over the years
      as well as the Wolfgang pauli experiment 

      [ might scrap and include in introduction]
      foucs more on experiment and theories/ ideas.

      SuperKamiokande experiment [ porved nutrinos to have mass]

      the T2K experiment proved cp viloation showing that the neutrino and anti neutrino have diffrent probabilities 
      NOva experiment contributed to this aswell ( in the us)

    <pre>
   in essence the standard model makes the assumption that neutrinos are massless and have a fixed flavour. as we've explored this is 
   not the case suggesting a massive gap in our framework of understanding outlining a flaw within the standard model. this is important
   as the SM is one of if not the most successful model when it comes to understanding a wide range of phenomena in the subatomic realm.

      The mechanism for generating neutrino masses is not yet fully understood despite oscilliations being observed, but there are several 
      theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain it.
      Firstly theres the notion of neutrinos being a Majorana fermion, whih implies that neutrinos initself are its own anti-particle. This
      in turn leads to the idea of neutrinoless double beta decay because as we know a neutrino is produced from a beta decay despite it be
